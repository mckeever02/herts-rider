            <p class="introduction">Driving is about freedom, independence and mobility, and having a disability shouldn’t change that. You might have to make certain compromises or accept some limitations, but there’s all sorts of technology available to help you get through your test and enjoy a life behind the wheel.</p>

            <p>To find out whether or not any condition you have will affect your ability to apply for a driving licence, check out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving" target="_blank">official list of medical conditions</a> and how they affect your ability to drive.</p>

            <p>If your disability is only minor, it shouldn’t affect your ability to drive and as far as the learning process is involved, it’s likely that you’ll be able to learn in a standard car (which may have to be an automatic) or one that requires only minor modifications. Such adjustments might include a steering ball on the steering wheel or a left-foot accelerator.</p>

            <p>If your disability is more severe you’ll probably have to drive a car that’s got some more comprehensive alterations, such as joystick or foot-operated steering. To pin down exactly what type of car you need – and whether or not you’re able to drive – you’ll need to contact one of the 17 <a href="http://www.mobility-centres.org.uk" target="_blank">Mobility Centres</a> in the UK.</p>

            <p>These centres can guide you through the various eligibility criteria for driving and steer you towards a local driving instructor who can help. They’ll also be able to tell you more about the various cars and modifications that are available, to help you get on the road.</p>

          <h2>The Motability Scheme</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column">
            <p>A registered charity that’s been going since 1978, more than 620,000 people are currently enjoying the benefits of the Motability scheme. This programme enables people to use their government-funded mobility allowance to lease a new car, scooter or powered wheelchair.</p>

            <p>The scheme works brilliantly in that you can have a new car every three years (every five if it’s a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle), and everything is taken care of. That means your insurance, tax, maintenance and breakdown cover are all included – even replacement windcsreen cover is included. You’re restricted to 20,000 miles per year, but that’s double the typical UK driver’s average.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, Motability can ensure that your car is suitable for you to use, so it can install whatever controls are needed for you to drive safely. And with around 450 different car models available, you shouldn’t struggle to find something suitable. For everything you could ever need to know about what Motability could do for you, log on to <a href="http://motability.co.uk" target="_blank">motability.co.uk.</a></p>

            <h2>Your driving licence as a disabled driver</h2>

            <p>The problem with many medical conditions is they they can get worse, potentially affecting your ability to drive. So while the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) may be happy to grant you a licence initially, any deterioration of your condition may result in you having your licence taken away.</p>

            <p>The same goes if you develop a 'notifiable' medical condition or disability; the onus is on you to tell the DVLA about it. Such conditions would include epilepsy, strokes, other neurological and mental health conditions, or physical disabilities and visual impairments that could affect your ability to drive safely.</p>

            <p>If you fail to tell the DVLA about your circumstances, you could be fined up to £1000 – and if you’re involved in a crash because you’re not fit to drive, you could be prosecuted – so while losing your independence will be a wrench, you could lose a lot more if you keep driving regardless.</p>

            <p>If there’s anything you need to know about driving with a medical condition or disability, log on to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-medical-conditions/telling-dvla-about-a-medical-condition-or-disability" target="_blank">gov.uk website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Meet Aaron</h2>
            <p>Aaron Morgan, 23, from Hampshire, is paralysed from the waist down following a motocross accident at the age of 15.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I’ve always been a massive fan of motor sports and would love to become a racing driver,” says Aaron. “After the accident, there was no way I was going to give up on my dream.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>After passing his driving test first time, Aaron decided to exchange his government-funded mobility allowance for a brand new car through the Motability Scheme; it’s an automatic with hand controls instead of foot pedals.</p>

            <p>He says: “My Motability vehicle has helped me so much. It has enabled me to live at university independently, travelling home when I need to and also aiding with shopping trips when on campus.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It has enabled me to travel safely, quickly and practically to work in my short career this far. It has also enabled me to pursue my hobbies. I have been able to travel to my races, as and when needed.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>Meet James</h2>
            <p>James is 18 and currently studying media and film studies. He was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair.</p>

            <p>James joined the Motability scheme in 2001 as a passenger, and when he became old enough to begin learning to drive, he applied to Motability for a grant towards his driving lessons. He’s now learning to drive in his Motability car, which has been adapted to suit his needs.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Before Motability, I used to be completely reliant on my parents to take me where I needed to go,” says James. “I am now able to take driving lessons in my own Motability car as it has been fitted with mechanical hand controls and steering aids. I can’t wait to pass my test and be able to drive myself to and from college.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>James does a lot of wheelchair racing and his Motability car enables him to travel to competitions and training. James says: &lquo;I have a lot of equipment to take with me including my wheelchair and racing chair, so the car is perfect for my needs.&rdquo;</p>
