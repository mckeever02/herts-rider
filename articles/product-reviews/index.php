            <p>Keeping your bike safe isn’t just about keeping it locked up. Many police forces say that one of the most effective forms of protection is a bike cover, so the thieves can’t see what’s under it. For that reason, the Oxford Aquatex (OF917) is extremely popular and it comes in all shapes and sizes from £24.99 for scooters and up. As well as being water-resistant and breathable, the Aquatex is elasticated at the bottom with a belly strap, so it can’t be blown off your bike in a gale and it has special reinforced eyelets to pass your chain lock through to secure everything down. </p>

            <p>The problem with a waterproof winter glove is that often they’re big and bulky and hinder rather than help you control the motorcycle. This isn’t the case with the Richa Waterproof Racing glove. These gloves feature a thin, lightweight lining, a moulded knuckle protector, reinforced palm, elasticated wrist and reassuring velcro cuff strap to keep them secure. Sizes go from XS – 2XL and any colour you like as long as it’s black.</p>

Each has been developed with ease of use and fitment in mind. They feature micro-electronics and moulded wiring, a rain-proof switch and today’s latest heated grips draw very little from your bike’s battery and take around an hour to fit.
