            <p class="introduction">Your bike needs to be serviced regularly, but it’s also worth giving it the quick once over before every ride, to make sure it’s in good condition.</p>

            <p class="u-cf">So try to get into a routine that takes these key things into account. There are six of them and they spell out POWDER: Petrol, Oil, Water, Damage, Electrics and Rubber</p>

            <p>Keep on top of these half a dozen things and you’ll massively cut the chances of being in a crash while you’re on your bike.</p>

                      <p>It’s not only important to check that you have enough fuel for your journey, but also, if you decide to lay your bike up for a long period of time, be sure to brim your tank with fuel. Petrol, unlike other fuels, is extremely cold; when it sits in your tank it will generate condensation, which in turn will mix with the petrol. Water mixed with petrol is seriously bad news as it’ll seriously damage your engine.</p>

Finally, check the level of the fluid in the brake reservoir mounted on your handlebars – it should be within the marked area.</p>

If possible put the bike on a paddock stand and spin the rear wheel with your hand and inspect, lubricate and clean your chain regularly. Tight spots, worn sprockets and rust could indicate either adjustment or replacement is necessary.</p>
