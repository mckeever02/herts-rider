            <p class="introduction">Making sure you’re protected is as important, if not more important, than picking the right bike. Fortunately, modern day biking kit isn’t as bulky or as expensive as it used to be with something for every budget &mdash; you really don’t have to break the bank to be protected against incidents and the elements. Here, Martin Brown from Bike Stop tells you everything you need to know to make sure you have the right kit for your riding.</p>

              <p>A helmet is your most important piece of safety equipment, so save a decent proportion of your budget to get a good one, as it could save your life. Motorcycle helmets sold in the UK must conform to ECE Regulation 22.05. A good retailer will guide you through this and will show you the label inside the helmet or on the shell.</p>

               <p>Many helmet manufacturers offer removable, washable cheek pads and liners to allow for adjustments to be made to the fit. There should be no tight spots or pressure points.

                 <p>A noisy helmet can make you tired and damage your hearing; noise can be influenced by wind speed and direction. Only a few helmets have been officially tested with numbers published. Other factors include the helmet fit and the number of vents and scoops but importantly, your riding position and the style of bike you ride has a huge influence on noise and is therefore quite difficult to quantify.</p>

            <h3>Take Care</h3>
            <p>When you buy a helmet, look after it. Regular cleaning with approved cleaners will keep it fresh and keeping the visor clean will reduce scratches and will increase the life of the visor. If you’re using it only occasionally, store it safely in a helmet bag where it won’t be dropped or knocked.</p>

              <h2>Gloves</h2>
              <p>Your hands are one of the first things to touch the ground if you come off your bike, so they must be protected. Fingers and wrists are fragile, so it doesn’t take much for them to sustain long-term damage. A pair of leather-palmed gloves will help take the sting out of a fall and prevent nasty injuries.</p>

              <p>Lighter gloves are available for summer riding with thermally insulated options for winter, but all-season options are available that can be worn all year round. Gloves should have a reinforced palm area to give increased abrasion resistance if you fall. Some also have hard plastic, metal or carbon fibre knuckle guards for added protection.</p>

              <p>Your hands are vulnerable in a crash and you can easily lose a finger if your hand gets trapped under you, so always wear specialist motorcycling gloves – a strong protective layer is essential.</p>

              <h2>Jackets</h2>
              <p>Whether you ride a 50cc moped or a 1200cc superbike, riding in your everyday clothes puts you at real risk of serious injury. Finding clothing to shield you from both impact and abrasion – the most common causes of injury – is extremely important, as is keeping you warm and dry if the weather takes a turn for the worse.</p>

              <p>Traditionally, leather has been the choice of most riders, but advances in textiles means that you now have options such as Cordura and other man-made fabrics which are abrasion-resistant and have waterproof treatments, coatings or a membrane. (Such as Gore-Tex). Make sure any jacket you buy has CE-approved armour in the risk areas, such as your elbows, shoulders and back. Many jackets don’t come with a back protector as standard, but should have a pocket that will allow one to be fitted.</p>

              <h2>Boots</h2>
              <p>A pair of sturdy over-the-ankle boots will provide support and protection for the ankle area and can prevent serious injuries, so it’s advised not to ride without them.</p>

              <p>In a crash, feet tend to get crushed sideways, so strong soles are important. A stitched sole is best and if possible bonded as well. Anything less and it may fall apart under impact or abrasion. The sole should contain ridges to provide good grip, and be at least 4mm thick. The thicker the sole, the more the boot will absorb the vibration of the bike.</p>

              <p>Boots come in varying levels of warmth and protection and range from a subtle black work style boot to multicoloured race replicas. Whatever style you go for, try them on to make sure they’re comfortable and allow you to operate the bike’s controls with ease.</p>

                 <p>Boots will get softer and more comfortable with use, but if a boot is too rigid it may lead to discomfort. Test their flexibility by manipulating them physically in the store, as well as trying them on.

              <h2>Trousers</h2>
              <p>Shorts and tracksuit bottoms are a real no-no when it comes to riding safely, as they offer zero protection in an accident. Jeans are slightly better, but will still wear through in under a second should the worst happen. A better option is to opt for a pair of jeans that are reinforced with Kevlar or other aramid fibre. Prices start at around £90 for a pair. The ultimate in protection however, is a pair of dedicated leather or textile trousers featuring double or triple stitching, plus CE-approved armour in the knees/shins.</p>

              <p>As with jackets, leather generally provides the most abrasion resistance, while textiles such as Cordura are waterproof and warm, so they can be used all year round.  Leather should be at least 1.2mm thick. Too thick and it’ll be uncomfortable and restrict your movement. Some will be treated to make it as waterproof as possible.</p>
