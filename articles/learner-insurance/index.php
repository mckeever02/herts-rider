            <p class="introduction">The high cost of professional driving tuition can limit the time you get behind the wheel. Independent practice can save cash, plus you’ll build experience and confidence faster. The problem can be getting insurance on the family car.</p>

            <p class="u-cf">This is where learner insurance comes in. This allows you to practise in somebody’s car, and instead of you being on their insurance, you’re covered by your own. You’re comprehensively insured too, so any claim is on your policy, not theirs.</p>

            <p>Annabel from London bought Marmalade’s learner insurance as soon as she turned 17, as she was convinced that extra driving hours in her parents’ car would help reduce her nerves when driving with an instructor.</p>

It also helped that the cover protects their &ldquo;I live in an area with very few public bus routes so Marmalade’s Learner Insurance was perfect for me as the owner of the car doesn’t have to be a passenger. I could head out and get a taste of the freedom as long as I was supervised by someone over the age of 25 who had held a full UK driver’s licence for at least three years.&rdquo;</p>
