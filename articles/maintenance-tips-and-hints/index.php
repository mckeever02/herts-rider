            <p>Here’s a bit of conflicting advice: get the best tools you need, but not necessarily straight away. If you’re starting out in bike maintenance, buy a couple of cheap socket sets and other basic tools. When they break, the ones you use often should be replaced with better-quality more expensive ones, which often come with a lifetime guarantee. This way you’ll soon build up a core collection of high-quality tools you use often, along with cheaper ones that you use only occasionally.</p>

              <p>There’s no need to go straight in with the big hammer or fire up the blow-torch to loosen stubborn nuts. Often you simply need to pre-empt your work and 24 hours before stripping something down you know could have issues with, simply spray all the major nuts and bolts with a good-quality penetration spray like WD-40 or ACF50. Buy the cans with the directable nozzle and you will be able to pin-point troublesome areas. Often a coating of spray in the right place can do just enough so you can loosen it.</p>

              <p>If you’re not comfortable when working on your bike you often don’t do a good job or can’t concentrate on what you’re doing. A good bike lift/ramp will ensure the bike is at the right height for you to work on it. With ramps you’ll still need good quality paddock stands to support the front and rear of the bike, but this will also mean you can remove wheels/fairings easily without hurting your back. It’s worth investing in a good stool with castors so you can whizz from tool box to ramp in comfort.</p>

          <h1>Information is power</h1>
          <p>Oh yes it is. Whatever bike you have, join the owners’ club. You’ll find all the hints and tips you’ll need online or in a regular newsletter. If you’re restoring a bike, replacing a regulator-rectifier, stripping brake callipers for cleaning or just changing the oil, other club members will have done it before. So ask. Never be afraid to ask or look daft asking obvious questions: we’ve all had to start somewhere. Much as they’re going out of fashion in this modern world, a Haynes or Clymer manual on your machine is vital if you’re planning any maintenance. </p>

          <h1>Use your phone as a tool</h1>
          <p>The modern smart phone is an amazingly, powerful device. Not only can you have help and pictures at your fingertips (from other bike owners), it can also record what you’re doing. Any removal/refitting of parts can be made easier if you’re taking pictures with your phone’s camera and you can make notes and record notes as you go along. That makes it invaluable.</p>

            <p>You don’t necessarily need made-to-measure overalls, but be sensible and wear the protection you need as accidents will happen. Some overalls or functional workwear is always handy, with plenty of pockets. Use eye protection if you’re doing any cutting. If you’re spraying use a face-mask and use gloves to protect your hands from oil or hazardous fluids.</p>

              <li>Bits and pieces that are handy to have if you’re working on bikes include a <strong>carb-balancing kit</strong> (only since around 2000 were the majority of bikes fuel-injected) so you can set up your carburettors to perfection. </li>
              <li>Carb issues are a big reason why bikes don’t run correctly, so an <strong>ultrasonic cleaner</strong> helps keep small carb parts clean and un-gummed from the ethanol-contained in pump fuel.</li>
              <li><strong>A tap and die set</strong> is handy for creating and repairing threads, while a coil spring compressor is good for removing suspension springs</li>
              <li>Whether or not you have power tools a <strong>compressor</strong> can be used for any manner of jobs, including cleaning.</li>
              <li>Finally, with wiring and electrics on motorcycles throwing up all manner of potential problems, a simple <strong>multi-meter</strong> will help you work out what is wrong and where, with your wiring.</li>
