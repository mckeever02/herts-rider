            <p>Don’t be daunted at the prospect of buying a used car. A bit of legwork can make it far less stressful.</p>

          <p class="introduction">If you’re strapped for cash, buying a used car is your only option, but if you buy a complete heap it could end up costing you more if it needs lots of new parts. That’s why you’ll probably need to spend at least £1000 on something worth having; sometimes there are perfectly good cars available for half this, but they can be a gamble.</p>

                   <p>Registration document or V5C. Tells you the basics about the car, how many owners it’s had and who it’s currently registered to. The person named on this form isn’t necessarily the legal owner of the car though. Don’t buy a car without a V5C and make sure it’s genuine by looking for the watermark.</p>

                        <p>Start the car from cold, and make sure it ticks over happily. Let it warm up then take it for a good run so you can check everything – make sure you’re insured though. While you’re driving, check
                        for a smoky exhaust, ensure there’s no misfiring (that the engine pulls cleanly) and also feel for pulling to one side under braking. Other issues could include a worn clutch (feel for slipping) and listen for any untoward noises – rattles, clonks or whining – that don’t sound right.</p>

                  <h3>Bodywork</h3>
                  <p>Look for dents and scrapes; also check panel fit. Any damage will be costly to put right. Check for rust that’s been painted over, plus filler in the wheelarches.</p>

                  <p>Have the tyres worn evenly; are they worn out altogether? Uneven wear suggests poorly aligned tracking (usually easily sorted) but could be something more serious.</p>

                  <h3>Chassis Number</h3>
                  <p>Does the chassis number (usually at the base of the windscreen on the passenger side) match the one on the registration document? Also check the engine number, which is usually on the top of the block, down the one side.</p>
