                Nick Gorringe is a 43-year old man with an understanding wife and a bike-mad son. He’s a lucky man because in 2014 he decided to take some time out after selling his business; his plan was to do something seriously adventurous. With a background in sailing and yachting Nick is no stranger to adventure, but with limited motorcycling experience (limited to day trips in the UK), a major global expedition was always going to be a major eye opener. But that didn’t stop him taking the plunge...
              </p>

              <h2>A new purchase</h2>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="imgix-fluid-bg imgix-image" style="padding-bottom:50%;" data-src="<? echo $imgix_path ?><? echo $page_issue2[''.$page_id.'']['id'];?>/images/bmw-gsa.jpg" alt="BMW GSA"></div>
              </div><!-- /row -->
              <p>I was thinking of buying a £17,000 BMW GSA at SBW Motorrad in Hertford and mentioned to the owner that if I bought such a bike I’d need to do something special with it. A DVD of <a href="http://www.globebusters.com/store/dvds/the-ride-london-to-beijing">The Ride</a> was produced, and having watched it I decided this was what I was looking for. I ordered the bike and specced it for some serious riding, although at this stage I didn’t know where to.</p>

              <p>Having watched the DVD I knew I’d travel with Globebusters, run by the hugely impressive Kevin Saunders. Any trip he was leading would be well planned, well executed and a damn good laugh too. But which trip?</p>

              <p>Looking at my options the trip had to be a big adventure to somewhere I’d never been, but all over in time for me to be back to spend the summer holidays with my 11-year old son. That settled it; there was a ride available from the UK to Xi’an, China, that took in 17 countries, eight weeks and 10,000 miles, finishing at the end of July. Perfect.</p>

              <h2>Starting off</h2>

              <p>Riding away from your house on a packed bike with 10,000 miles ahead of you, knowing that you’ll ride to China before you come back is a weird feeling. I said goodbye to my family and headed to London to meet the 10 people who would be my companions for the next two months.</p>

              <p>In the group was a pair of Australians, an American, two guys from Thailand, a Swiss chap and a couple from London, plus Kevin the ride leader and his 22-year old son Rhys, who was tagging along in a bid to become the youngest to motorcycle around the world.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;17 countries, 56 days and a massive mix of cultures, terrain, customs and officialdom...&rdquo;</p>
              </blockquote>
            </div>

              <div class="longform-text-container">

              <p>We all had a big ride ahead; 17 countries, 56 days and a massive mix of cultures, terrain, customs and officialdom is what I’m expecting as we set off from the Ace Café. I’d taste all of this and more, some to my delight and some to my outright despair.</p>

              <h2>Conquering Europe</h2>

              <p>Although Europe offers a diverse collection of cultures and experiences, the first days zipping through France, Germany, Austria and Slovenia had to be despatched so I could get on with the real adventure; some say that Europe is ‘in the way’ rather than ‘on the way’. The time spent riding the wonderful roads of France and the forest trails of Germany gave me time to acclimatise to living on the bike, packing and unpacking every night, and setting up a routine. It may not be the final frontier but it’s certainly a great training ground for anyone going further afield.</p>

              <p>Once I was out of the Euro Zone, border crossings become more of an event which need planning. Arrive too late and I’d be in a huge queue of trucks, too early will see me waiting for hours. I had the luxury of Kevin’s expertise and his experience of having ridden this route several times before. We generally got it right, had our paperwork in order and knew where to get money changed. Without this, it may have been a lottery in terms of timing and ease of passage. I soon learnt to be organised and business-like but always presented myself with a smile to get things done quickly.</p>

              <p>Cash is king in most of the countries I travelled through. None more so than Uzbekistan. The currency is the Som. The largest note is 2000 som which at the time was worth 17 pence. Exchanging a couple of hundred dollars resulted in a huge wad of notes that was hard to carry and store. An evening meal could easily be 500,000 som, or five bricks of notes which all needed counting; quite a challenge after a couple bottles of the local ‘sarbast’...</p>

              <h2>Roads scholar</h2>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="imgix-fluid-bg imgix-image" style="padding-bottom:50%;" data-src="<? echo $imgix_path ?><? echo $page_issue2[''.$page_id.'']['id'];?>/images/roads-scholar.jpg" alt="Roads scholar"></div>
              </div><!-- /row -->

              <p>Before departing I’d heard and read many accounts of what the roads would be like; I now know that road networks and tarmac surfaces come and go rapidly. A tarmac road through the Turkmenistan desert that’s travelled by a thousand trucks a day in the searing heat soon turns into a terrifying melted rut-covered trail that tests every element of your riding skills and courage. A rocky gravel trail through the mountains of Northern China can turn into a dual-carriageway just like that.</p>

              <p>Realistically, I could have ridden from London to China without doing any off-road riding, but I had to be prepared to encounter anything. Landslides aren’t always quickly sorted, sand can soon cover a desert road, and extreme weather in remote locations can change the landscape dramatically. Be prepared, carry water and food and be prepared to stop, and you’ll be fine.</p>

              <p>At the other extreme, China is rapidly laying huge lengths of motorway, which are smooth and straight. The miles would have quickly disappeared if I’d sat on one of these for a day, but I would have been denied the opportunity to take in rural China and I’d have missed the reason why I’d ridden this far in the first place. Besides, not all Chinese motorways allow motorcycles so we couldn’t count on being able to use them.</p>

              <h2>It’s official</h2>

                <div class="two-thirds column">
                  <p>The police and officials are generally interested in groups of foreign-plated motorcycles. Chinese officials want to chat and have a photo in exchange for a cold drink or watermelon. The Kazakhstan boys in blue were keen to chat and extract ‘Benjamins’ from us (dollars and the chance to ride away without any aggro). The best response is to say ‘no Benjamin’ and insist they write you a ticket which you can take to their boss for payment. The request soon goes away, even if you do get caught on camera doing four times the speed limit!</p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>Customs officers could be our worst nightmare or our best friend. A friendly one, as experienced entering Kazakhstan, would just want us out of the way and will do anything to avoid any additional paperwork. A bad one like the first guy I encountered in Turkmenistan arrested me for carrying prescription drugs and had me taken away into the desert for questioning and medical examination for 48 hours before telling me to leave their country. This part of the trip is a book in itself and an experience you should not try to replicate if you’re heading that way!</p>

              <p>The biggest unknown was how the Chinese would process us when crossing a border in the North West near Xining, as not many westerners on motorbikes come through that way. All the anticipation was put to rest when upon approaching, all the official staff where standing in a line waving and cheering. Welcome to China! After swift processing and a go in the X-raying machine we were sent on our way. This typified what we experienced throughout the three-week journey across their country.</p>

              <p>You must be prepared to wait. The longest wait I had was eight hours – in 45 degrees with no shade and only the water I was carrying. Once we started being processed we had to give our details to one person after another but the secret to success is to stay calm, and pay your entry fees along with your insurance. Don’t tell them you’re English and have rights unless you fancy the full treatment!</p>

              <h2>Me, myself and I</h2>

              <p>The joy of knowing there will be someone along soon to keep you company is brilliant; if you’re stranded on a desert road or freezing mountain side, the added security is comforting. The chance to share tales of the road every evening over a beer is wonderful and allowed us to fill in a few gaps or just kick back and sample the local delights in great company.</p>

              <p>On the road I preferred to ride by myself, but I didn’t really do enough of that. When you hook up with one or two others for the day your approach changes. If you’re navigating (I generally was) you have a feeling of greater responsibility, looking for fuel, food and hazards on behalf of everyone. Great for a few days but the freedom of being on your own and stopping when it suits you is liberating. One man and one bike looking at a map in the middle of the Kazakhstan steppe certainly confirms you’re on an adventure.</p>

              <p>This trip started out as a motorbike thing, but over time it became less and less about motorcycling. The things I saw, the surprise wow moments and the people I met were the real joys of a trip like this; the bike just facilitates things. Doing a similar trip by car would be very different. To many of the people in remote regions, you’re an alien on a huge alien motorcycle. They want to know who you are, where you’ve come from and where you’re going. Early in the trip I was keen to judge when the amazement of where I was going would be replaced by amazement at where I had come from. I reckon once in Turkmenistan, the other side of the Caspian Sea, people were more surprised by London than China.</p>


              <h2>New experiences</h2>

              <p>Every single mile of every single day offered me something I had probably never seen before and this is what adventure is about. There was no turning back; all situations had to be dealt with. Imagine waking up every morning and seeing new things and meeting new people for the first time, every day for two months. It’s a terrific experience that made me smile all day every day.</p>

              <p>I never had any preconception of what I would feel spending eight hours a day for two months inside my helmet. What would make me smile or what would get me down. Firstly, nothing got me down as every situation or challenge that presented itself was an adventure. Some of it was exhilarating, some fantastic and some just a bit of drag. But nothing was bad.</p>

              <p>Interestingly the least impact was made by all the sights that we have become accustomed to seeing. For example, the Great Wall of China is an amazing structure with a rich and incredible history, but I felt I’d seen it all before through the media. But riding around the corner on a dirt street to be faced with a city made of sand at Khiva in Uzbekistan was mind-blowing and made me literally go ‘wow’ in my helmet. The unexpected is more exciting than the scripted!</p>

              <p>The continuous change in people and cultures along the route is also a joy. It’s always an opportunity to learn something new, a different way of pouring tea or the new word for beer. You never get off the bike knowing exactly what’s going to happen, but thankfully we were generally welcomed with open arms by people who would give us everything although they had nothing. Ultimately everyone, everywhere, has the same basic needs, and the same basic routine – they just live somewhere different from you and I. </p>

              <p>The Chinese in rural areas were fascinated by our big bikes, the Georgians just want to hoot their horns and wave whilst the Uzbeks wanted to feed us. One thing they all have in common is a standard set of questions which are delivered by a variety of dodgy translations and mimes: Where are you going? Where do you come from? How much does the bike cost? How fast does it go?</p>

              <p>After a while you get a bit naughty with the answers and I now believe there are number of central Asian villagers who believe a BMW GSA costs $1million and has a top speed of 300mph...</p>

              <p>People are 99.9% good, at no point on this adventure did I feel threatened, concerned or unwelcome, (Turkmenistan excluded). Nothing was stolen but I did probably pay a few tourist rates for fuel. But then I was a tourist.</p>

              <h2>Food for thought</h2>

              <p>There’s one thing you can’t do without and that’s fuel for you and your bike. After hours of riding in the sun without hydrating, your decision-making abilities drop off. So drink little and frequently, get into the habit of regular wee stops (checking that it’s clear) to ensure you’ve been drinking enough. Stick with sealed bottles of water only or cans of soft drink. Urinating on the roadside is fine, bad guts and number twos is not!</p>

              <p>Food isn’t a problem. Everyone needs it and everyone eats it. The type of food available may be a little different from what you normally have but after over 50 kebabs of one style or another and a live frog you pretty much eat anything available if it’s fresh and cooked properly. Taking a look at the kitchen is a good idea; the locals aren’t embarrassed about it and you can eat in the knowledge that your meat on a stick didn’t used to be called Rover and chase cats.</p>

              <p>Regularly filling the GSA’s big tank took little planning, as most of the way we could source fuel. The BMW’s 400-mile range helped here. Fuel is generally exchanged only for cash, as cards are unloved outside Europe; the theory that US dollars are taken everywhere isn’t true though. Each country has its own currency and that’s what they want. Unless you’re a crooked Kazak policeman looking for a bonus!</p>

              <h2>At the end of the day...</h2>

              <p>As my trip was a Globebusters expedition, all accommodation was sorted out, pre-booked and paid for by them. ‘The best hotel in town’ was the plan. Sometimes this was a gleaming glass tower in a modern Chinese city, other times it was a modest industrial workers’ hotel in a provincial oil or mining town. There was only one occasion when the best hotel was the only hotel; in Kazakhstan near the Chinese border. A bit like staying at your gran’s 40 years ago, but the people were friendly.</p>

              <p>One night was spent under the stars at the amazing Darvaza gas crater in Turkmenistan, a tough and hot one that made the next night in Khiva even more welcome. Parking and security were never a problem and it’s hugely reassuring to have a GPS co-ordinate to head for each day for your hotel for the night; a safe target that sells beers..</p>

              <p>Being on the road for two months gives you time to think. A lot of what I thought about was the here and now and very little about any bigger picture. I thought about my family, lots. I thought about how simple life can be and deliver so much enjoyment. I thought about my bike and my kit and how well it all performed. And I thought a lot about the next trip..</p>
