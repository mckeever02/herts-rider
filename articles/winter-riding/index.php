            <p class="introduction">Should you or shouldn’t you ride a motorcycle during the winter months? Are you or are you not an ‘all-year biker’? Some of us prefer to enjoy motorcycling only during the warmer months, preferring the car during winter. Others look upon all-year riding as a rite-of-passage to being a ‘proper’ biker, as it hones your skills. The great thing is, they’re both right.</p>

            <p>Firstly, if you don’t want to ride all year – don’t do it. Winter or cold-weather riding throws up unique challenges, so never feel pressured into riding when you don’t want to. For many, we do it when we’re younger and when a motorcycle is our only method of transport. The great thing today is that with modern clothing, kit and tyres, year-round riding is possible through all but the worst British winter.</p>

            <p>For successful winter riding you really need to look at three main elements: your bike, your kit and your riding.</p>

                <span class="small-text footnote">Winter hack</span>
                <p>Some riders have a winter-only bike to use in the off-season. It can make financial sense. If you have just one bike to use, liberally coat it with WD-40 or ACF50 as a protectant: dirt and grime sticks to it and it can be washed off. Also ensure you clean your bike regularly in the winter months, so road salt can’t corrode vital parts. </p>

            <h3>Layer up</h3>
            <p>Riding in the cold is like an extreme winter sport, so layer up accordingly. You need a thermal base layer, a wind/waterproof layer then a protective outer cover. Most modern textile two-piece ranges have the outer two layers built-in and often these can be removable so you can replace armour with CE-approved items (if it isn’t already) and remove the fleece/waterproof layer in the summer months. Don’t forget good boots and gloves too – make them waterproof and pack a warming neck tube or balaclava. In the old days we’d stuff jackets with newspaper and line summer boots with plastic bags, but today’s winter kit is more affordable than ever and does a much better job. Alternatively, use your summer kit but invest in a good, waterproof one- or two-piece over-layer and a good base thermal layer.</p>

          <h3>Heated Kit</h3>
          <p>Modern heated kit takes the pain out of riding in winter. You can get vest/jacket liners, gloves and inner-soles for boots. With modern electronics, electrics and battery technology you can choose from kit which attaches to your bike’s battery or kit that is run from a small, rechargeable battery, taking the strain off your motorcycle’s battery.</p>

            <p>Keep your helmet and visor in tip-top condition. Remove/clean the lining regularly and keep your visors clean and scratch-free. Some helmets can have an integral drop-down sun-visor which is handy in the morning/evening when the winter sun is low in the sky. Also consider a high-definition visor insert or visor. This turns the gloomiest wet-weather into pin-sharp focus so you can see those damp patches. Anti-mist sprays or pinlock inserts keep away fogging, while anti-water coatings on the outside keep it off your visor. Use it on your mirrors too.</p>

Many modern bikes have traction control and ABS, but other, older machines don’t – so ride to the conditions, being smooth with your application of throttle and brake. Change up through the gears earlier and apply the brakes smoother and sooner – remembering that stopping distances will be considerably greater.</p>

            <p>You’ll tire quicker if you’re not warm and comfortable, so plan on taking longer to do the same trips you did in the summer. If travelling far take plenty of breaks to get warm and keep your fluid levels up. Remember: the colder you are the slower your reactions. And keep your distance from vehicles ahead – keep away from their spray.</p>
