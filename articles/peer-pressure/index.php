            <p class="introduction">Doing crazy things is a natural part of being alive; the problems start when your crazy actions kill or injure other people, and where driving is concerned, that’s a very real possibility.</p>

            <p class="u-cf">Drivers must focus 100% on driving – not reading texts or playing with an MP3 player. Even having a conversation can be so distracting that your safety is compromised. Grab their attention at just the wrong time during a manoeuvre, and it can all go horribly wrong.</p>

            <p>So if you want to stay alive, make sure you don’t fall into the trap of doing any of these things – or you might not live to regret it.</p>
