            <p class="introduction">Motorcyclists make up 1% of the total traffic on the UK’s roads, but account for over 20% of the total numbers killed or seriously injured. Or put another way, you’re over 20 times more likely to be involved in a crash on a motorcycle than in a car.</p>

            <p>Unlike car drivers, who rely on the millions of pounds of research and development that manufacturers put into improving the safety of car occupants in the event of an accident, motorcycle riders don’t have that luxury. </p>

            <p>On a bike, there are no side impact bars, crumple zones or driver airbags to save you when things go pear-shaped, so the best way to stay intact is to not get into a sticky situation in the first place. </p>

            <p>That’s why motorcyclists need even greater awareness on the road, of their own actions, their surroundings, the road surfaces, and the actions of others around them. But you can cope with it all; here’s how.</p>

              <p>Visibility isn’t just about how well you can see; it’s also about how easily other road users can see you. The Police Rider’s Handbook (Roadcraft) says that a third of drivers involved in a daylight collision with a motorcyclist claim not to have seen the motorcycle before the crash. At night that figure rises to half. </p>

              <p>Part of the reason bikes can be hard to spot is that the head-on view of a rider and machine is relatively small compared with most road traffic, making it difficult to assess speed. If the road’s busy, a rider can all too easily get lost against a cluttered background with disastrous results. That’s why you need to make yourself as conspicuous as possible.</p>

            <p>Riding with friends can be fun, but it increases the risk of succumbing to peer pressure. When riding with others, trust your own judgement. There may be quicker riders &mdash; but that doesn’t make them better riders. Stick to your own limits and don’t be pressured into going faster than you feel is safe for the conditions.</p>
