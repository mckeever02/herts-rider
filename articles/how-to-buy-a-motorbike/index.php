            <p class="introduction">Whether you’re looking at doing a deal on a brand new machine or snapping up a secondhand steed, there’s lots to consider if you’re to make the right choice when buying a motorbike. Get it wrong and it can be a costly hell, get it right and it’s heaven.</p>

            <p>Over the following article we’ll steer you through the minefield that is buying a new or used motorbike &mdash; so you end up with the bike that’s right for you.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <span class="small-text footnote">Top tip</span>
            <p>Remember to budget for insurance cover. Third party is the minimum with fully comprehensive the best, but most expensive option</p>
          </blockquote>

          <div class="longform-text-container">
            <p>If you’re a new rider you’ll potentially face high premiums, but this will drop as your experience and no-claims bonus increases. Sporty bikes will also attract higher premiums, whereas scooters and commuter bikes are usually less.</p>

            <p>Be sure to declare everything when applying so you’re covered in the event of a claim. To get the best deal, ring round or check online to find the most competitive deal.</p>

            <p>Search for bike insurance specialists online to cover all the bases, and make sure you check out our <a href="../motorcycle-insurance/">page on getting the best insurance deal</a>.</p>

            <p>Buying new from a dealer means you’ll know your bike hasn’t been abused and it’ll probably come with at least two years’ warranty. But you’ll pay for these benefits, as depreciation is greatest in the first year of ownership.</p>

              <p>Bring both parts of your driving licence and ID if you want a test ride. Major retailers will have demonstrators, but other dealers may have a used model you can test. Try other bikes that fit your criteria too.</p>

              <p>Haggling to get the price down is part of the process, so make a lower offer. Check you’re negotiating the On The Road (OTR) price, which includes all those little extra charges that can add up. Ask about what extras they can give you – luggage, a new helmet, clothing or security products. You could walk away with a bundle if the salesman is desperate for a sale.</p>

            <p>If you’ve not got the cash for a new bike, finance could be the way to go, spreading the cost of your bike into more manageable portions over a period of time that suits you. Many manufacturers offer great finance deals on new bikes – some even come with a year’s free insurance – which could save you a packet. Look online for the latest offers from all the key motorcycle manufacturers.</p>

            <p>Buying from a dealer means you’re protected by the Sale of Goods Act, which says goods must meet an acceptable standard. If your bike develops a fault the dealer must fix it; if there’s a major problem you can ask for a replacement or refund.</p>

              <p>Learn as much as you can about a bike before viewing it. Magazines and internet forums can give you information about common problems and what to look out for. Finding out the cost of consumables such as tyres and chains could give you more haggling power if these need replacing. Also, check what the going rate is for that model and age by comparing it with similar bikes for sale.</p>

              <p>Always view a secondhand bike in good weather in natural light to have the best chance of spotting any issues. Take your time to inspect every area of the bike. If anything looks wrong, it probably is. Be prepared to walk away – there are plenty of other used bikes out there, that you can buy.</p>

              <p>Check the engine and exhaust for signs of warmth, which could mean the seller warmed the bike up before you got there, hiding starting problems. Once started, check for excessive engine noise or smoke. Check the operation of all lights, gauges, gears, brakes, horn and push on the bars and seat to see if the suspension settles properly.</p>
