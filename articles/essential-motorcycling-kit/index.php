            <p>When you buy a helmet look after it. Regular cleaning will keep it fresh and the visor clear. If you’re using it only occasionally, store it safely in a helmet bag where it won’t be dropped or knocked. Don’t personalise your helmet with stickers, as the adhesives can weaken the shell, reducing its effectiveness in a crash.</p>

              <p>Your hands are one of the first things to touch the ground if you come off your bike, so they must be protected. Fingers and wrists are fragile, so it doesn’t take much for them to sustain long-term damage. </p>

              <p>A pair of leather-palmed gloves will help take the sting out of a fall and prevent nasty injuries. Lighter gloves are available for summer riding with thermally insulated options for winter, but all-season options are available that can be worn all year round.</p>

              <p>Gloves should have a reinforced palm area to give increased abrasion resistance if you fall. Some also have hard plastic, metal or carbonfibre knuckle guards for added protection.</p>

              <p>Your hands are vulnerable in a crash and you can easily lose a finger if your hand gets trapped under you, so always wear specialist motorcycling gloves &mdash; a strong protective layer is essential.</p>

              <h2>Jackets</h2>
              <p>Whether you ride a 50cc moped or a 1200cc superbike, riding in your everyday clothes puts you at real risk of serious injury. Finding clothing to shield you from both impact and abrasion &mdash; the most common causes of injury &mdash; is extremely important, as is keeping you warm and dry if the weather takes a turn for the worse.</p>

              <p>Traditionally, leather has been the choice of most riders, but advances in textiles means that you now have options such as Cordura and Gore-Tex, which are abrasion-resistant and waterproof.</p>

              <p>Make sure any jacket you buy has CE-approved armour in the risk areas, such as your elbows, shoulders and back. Finally, make sure it’s comfortable when seated on a bike.</p>

              <h4>Types of jacket</h4>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Leather:</strong> should be at least 1.2mm thick. Too thick and it’ll be uncomfortable and restrict your movement. Some will be treated to make it as waterproof as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Textile:</strong> Cordura gives protection from the elements, while the thermal and waterproof linings are often removable to allow for use in the spring or summer – they provide body armour too and are often multi-adjustable.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Boots</h2>
              <p>A pair of sturdy over-the-ankle boots will provide support and protection for the ankle area and can prevent serious injuries, so it’s advised not to ride without them. In a crash, feet tend to get crushed sideways, so strong soles are important. A stitched sole is best, and if possible bonded as well. Anything less and it may fall apart under impact or abrasion.</p>

              <p>The sole should contain ridges to provide good grip, and be at least 4mm thick. The thicker the sole, the more the boot will absorb the vibration of the bike. Boots come in varying levels of warmth and protection and range from a subtle black work boot to multicoloured race replicas. </p>

              <p>Boots should ideally be made from good quality leather (at least 2.5mm thick) and be waterproof too. Some models come with additional armour areas in vulnerable spots such as the outer toes, ankles and shins. Whatever style you go for, try them on to make sure they’re comfortable and allow you to operate the bike’s controls with ease. </p>

            <p>Don't wear work boots with steel toe-caps. These can protect your feet in certain circumstances but are also capable of cutting through your toes.</p>

              <h2>Trousers</h2>
              <p>Shorts and tracksuit bottoms are real no-nos when it comes to riding safely, as they offer zero protection in an accident. Jeans are slightly better, but can still wear through in under a second should the worst happen. A better option is to opt for a pair of jeans that are reinforced with Kevlar. Prices start at around £90 for a pair.</p>

              <p>The ultimate in protection is a pair of dedicated leather or textile trousers featuring double or triple stitching, plus CE-approved armour in the knees. As with jackets, leather provides the most abrasion resistance, while textiles such as Cordura are waterproof and warmer, so they can be used all year round.</p>

              <p>Just like jackets, trousers can be made of either leather or a textile, with leather being the best for abrasion resistance and textile topping the tree for waterproofing and comfort. Make sure any in-built armour is CE-approved.</p>

              <p>Make sure your trousers fit well and are comfortable when you’re sitting on the bike, allowing you a full range of motion and letting you operate the bike’s controls easily.</p>
