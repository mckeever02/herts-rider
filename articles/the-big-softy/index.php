            <p class="introduction">Yamaha’s XJR1300 has been around for quite a while. In fact, for the last 20 years the XJR has been delighting us with its retro-based charm. Launched in 1995 as the XJR1200, the motorcycle was a refreshing look at the then-burgeoning retro bike scene. The early to mid-1990s was a time when we looked back on the 1970s and early 1980s with fondness and the XJR with its big, finned air-cooled four-cylinder motor from the FJ1200/1100 family of sports tourers was the perfect bike to take us there.</p>

            <p>Compared with the fully faired latest sportsbikes of the day, it was a rose-tinted look at a simpler motorcycling way of life.</p>

            <p>Along with competitors such as Kawasaki’s ZRX and Zephyr range and Honda’s CB750 and 1000, the XJR took us back to a time of un-faired and unfettered fun on two wheels. The thing is, as the XJR grew by 62cc into the XJR1300 for 1999 and acquired fuel injection for 2007, the bike itself seemed to grow in stature. </p>

            <p>In the UK the bike became more than just a point-and-squirt-to-the-pub fun bike. XJRs suddenly grew fly-screens and throw-over or hard panniers and became tourers. They also became ‘SP’ or ‘Sports Production’ models and raced (in France.) People took them to their hearts, to their favourite roads and to distant locations: little wonder the XJR has many, popular, well-run owners’ clubs in the UK and abroad. Now, 20 years on, all that has changed.</p>

            <p>Today’s XJR is different. It’s a fashion item. All the old traits are still there: simple, uncluttered lines, a big air-cooled 1250cc motor with more grunt than a 1970’s wrestling bout: but today’s XJR is all about less being more. When I say that, I mean less bodywork. The once long tail unit which could happily take you and the missus to the coast and back is now stunted, with a cut-down subframe supporting just an excuse for a curved pillion seat. The broad tank which once housed 21 litres of fuel is now narrow (and plastic) and holds just 14.5 litres, just so that the engine can jut out past the tank in the café racer fashion…</p>

            <p>You see, the modern XJR is aimed at a different breed of biker than the original back in the mid-1990s. There’s a trend on two wheels and it’s that of the biking hipster: someone who wants to ride a unique ‘one-off’ motorcycle special or café racer that makes them feel that little bit different. For Yamaha, they decided to make the XJR1300 this kind of bike. But did it work?</p>

            <p>Now, I’ve ridden XJRs since 1999 and loved them. XJRs were (for me) like big, friendly dogs: easy going, nice to look at and with plenty of bark when needed. I’d toured on an XJR and ridden an SP version around the track, so to swing a leg over this incarnation was going to be interesting. But I realised things have changed immediately.</p>

            <p>The old model’s big, rectangular chrome mirrors used to let you see whatever was behind you, but – for fashion’s sake – they’ve been replaced by tiny ones that show nothing but your elbows. That slimmed tank, smaller headlight and two strange oval number boards where the large side panels should be, also take away the butch, bruiser look of the original bike.</p>

            <p>Thankfully when you ride the new XJR, much is still the same. The scalloped seat is comfortable (for one person) and while she is a big bus, she can haul up her skirt and jig when she needs to. Helping here are the fantastic and fashionable Ohlins rear shocks, adjustable for rebound and preload which tell you what’s happening at the rear end. Up front are fully adjustable forks. I hardly touched the suspension, save for putting a bit more preload on the rear. Sure, the XJR isn’t a road scalpel like a sportsbike, but you soon get used to the minimal effort needed to nudge her into the next bend. Helping you get to and from each bend is the star performer in this package: the motor.</p>

            <p>It really is an impressive performer: top gear at 70mph equates to 4000rpm (about half-way around the clear tacho) and that’s a nice place to be. It allows you to wind on and off that throttle depending on the upcoming corners without having to dance too much on the shift lever, under which sits five nicely spaced gears. In fact, the only dance you’re doing is some sort of funky chicken as you desperately lift each elbow up to see something – anything – in those daft mirrors. Thankfully the brakes aren’t daft. The monoblock four-piston calipers do a superb job of gripping those 298mm discs and bring the not insubstantial 240 kilos of XJR to a halt pretty rapidly. Open road enjoyment is what the XJR is all about and it delivers. For a while…</p>

            <p>Why just a while? Well, apart from the mirrors the only way the riding experience is affected by the style of this ‘new’ XJR is if you want to do any sort of distance. With a tiny tank you will see reserve by about 80 miles. I could barely squeeze a tenner’s worth of unleaded in the tank (about 10 litres) and the thing had been registering as being on reserve for a good 8-10 miles. Sometimes with the trip reading as low as 70 miles, you’d pop the thing on the sidestand and find it was telling you it was on reserve. Form has sadly won over function here, which is a shame as the XJR used to have much longer legs.</p>

            <p>These few issues aside the XJR is a refined machine which is well-made and is fun for the task at hand. These shots show just what that is: uncluttered, simple biking in the warm glow of summer. Just don’t expect this model to spread its wings and become a maid-of-all-work like the original, or tackle a two-up tour in the rain as well as it did 20 years ago. </p>
