              <p class="introduction">For enthusiasts Julie and Alex Bello, biking has been an escape, a stress relief mechanism, from the life of raising their 26-year old daughter Natasha, who suffers from multiple disabilities. As a result of being in a severe car crash as a baby, Natasha needs constant care and until recently these complexities gave the couple very little time to devote to the pursuit of happiness on two wheels.</p>
            </div><!-- /row -->

            <p>
              One day in 2012 the Bellos were at their local BMW motorcycle dealer <a href="http://www.sbwmotorrad-bmw.com">SBW Motorrad</a> when they saw a bike with a sidecar. The dealership’s Stephen Crowder is well known locally for his sidecar creations, as each one is bespoke. While he works to a regular basic design, the design of each rig is tweaked so it complements the bike to which it’s attached. SBW had already produced several sidecars but none was designed with a disabled occupant in mind.
            </p>


            <p>
              Says Julie: “It sparked an idea: what if we could increase our adventures on three wheels, taking our daughter with us? That spark grew to a smouldering pile of questions: how could we make it work? How would we get her in and out? How far could we travel? Will she get cold? The list was seemingly endless. These questions hung around for at least a year”.
            </p>

            <p>
              Julie continues: “I'm not sure what propelled the idea to the next level. Another sidecar was about to be shipped out to a customer, so SBW asked if we would we like to take Natasha for a ride? Well who could resist? Alex went out for a test ride with a member of staff, as it wasn’t just about Natasha sitting in the sidecar – the enjoyment of riding the bike to which it was attached was also key”.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soon after this, Natasha was taken out in the sidecar for her first ‘experience’. It lasted just 20 minutes but it all went very well which is why the Bellos arranged for a longer trip shortly after. That trip took in around 90 minutes’ worth of Hertfordshire riding which went well too. There was only one thing for it; the Bellos needed to place an order. They didn’t want to give up either of their two existing motorbikes, so the decision was made to buy a third; a BMW R1200 GSA.

                  Once the bike had been delivered in August 2014, the first task was to get the first 600 miles on its clock to run it in. Then it was the big step; turning it over to SBW, who would design and build a sidecar to look as though it left the factory already attached to the GSA. It wasn't a quick or easy feat which is why the build took several months.

            </div>

            <p class="container-margin-top">
              Some of the features of the sidecar would take time to establish. The two most important initially were a comfortable seat (a heated item from a Land Rover) and some way of carrying the manual folding wheelchair. Even now there are still more adjustments to be made, mainly to find an easier way to get Natasha in and out as it is still quite difficult – but ideas are being discussed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The build was taking place as the dealership was moving from Hertford to Welwyn Garden City. The almost-completed rig was put on show at the new location’s opening night, hosted by Charlie Boorman and Simon Pavey. At the end of the evening they sat in the rig – a memorable moment for everyone involved in the project. Soon after that the Bellos brought their new baby home.

            <h2 class="container-margin-top">The Big Test</h2>

            <p>
              SBW had been encouraging Julie and Alex to make the pilgrimage to the huge BMW Motorrad event held in July in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. That’s right down on the southern tip of Germany, so the Bellos had to figure out a way to make it work. The solution was for Alex to ride the sidecar to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, with Julie and Natasha flying to Munich then catching a train to the event. The three of them rode the sidecar onto the SBW show stand on the Saturday.
            </p>

            <p>
              Julie comments: “On the Sunday we began the three-day journey home. This was going to be a big test of stamina for all three of us, travelling in high temperatures through the Black Forest to Titisee, which is almost 200 miles. The second day was about finding suitable rest stops for Natasha. We did at least 300 miles due to missing a turn and doing a detour around wine country.”

                  “On the third day we rode from Reims to Watford, another 300-mile journey. We almost made it home, but just half an hour away the front tyre suffered a nasty puncture, making it very difficult to ride – cue another story, for another day, on our attempts to get home! Overall though, Natasha did a top job of being a sidecar passenger”.

            <p class="container-margin-top">
              Since coming back from Germany in July 2015 the Bellos have done a few more rideouts. These include a group ride with SBW and taking part in the Ring of Red Right of Respect around the M25. In December they did the Christmas Toy Run with the ACE Café, and happened to win the ‘Best Dressed Bike’ award. Now, with the bike and sidecar having proved what it can do, the Bellos will be using their ensemble more than ever. So if you see them on their travels, make sure you give them a wave.
