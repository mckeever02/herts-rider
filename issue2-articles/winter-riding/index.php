            <p class="introduction">Should you or shouldn’t you ride a motorcycle during the winter months? Are you or are you not an ‘all-year biker’?</p>

            <p>Some of us prefer to enjoy motorcycling only during the warmer months, preferring the car during winter. Others look upon all-year riding as a rite-of-passage to being a ‘proper’ biker, as it hones your skills. The great thing is, they’re both right.
</p>

            <p>Firstly, if you don’t want to ride all year – don’t do it. Winter or cold-weather riding throws up unique challenges, so never feel pressured into riding when you don’t want to. For many, we do it when we’re younger and when a motorcycle is our only method of transport. The great thing today is that with modern clothing, kit and tyres, year-round riding is possible through all but the worst British winter.</p>

            <p>For successful winter riding you really need to look at three main elements: your bike, your kit and your riding.</p>

          <h1>Your Bike</h1>

          <p class="large-text">You need your bike in tip-top condition whatever the season, but there are some things you need to look out for especially, if you ride in the winter.</p>



          <div class="row">
            <div class="longform-text-container">
              <p>Visibility isn’t just about how well you can see; it’s also about how easily other road users can see you. The Police Rider’s Handbook (Roadcraft) says that a third of drivers involved in a daylight collision with a motorcyclist claim not to have seen the motorcycle before the crash. At night that figure rises to half. </p>

              <p>Part of the reason bikes can be hard to spot is that the head-on view of a rider and machine is relatively small compared with most road traffic, making it difficult to assess speed. If the road’s busy, a rider can all too easily get lost against a cluttered background with disastrous results. That’s why you need to make yourself as conspicuous as possible.</p>

            <p>Riding with friends can be fun, but it increases the risk of succumbing to peer pressure. When riding with others, trust your own judgement. There may be quicker riders &mdash; but that doesn’t make them better riders. Stick to your own limits and don’t be pressured into going faster than you feel is safe for the conditions.</p>
