            <p class="introduction">Even priced as low as £8,149 the Tracer is not a budget motorcycle. It is not stripped down to bare essentials, a pale imitation of better equipped bikes. It doesn't have a measly engine, dressed up in fairings too big for the capacity. Forget the stereotype that a low asking price means low quality. This is a solid machine: a firm and light chassis, Yamaha's punchy 847cc triple engine and a whole range of bang-on-the-money accessories.</p>

           <p>I'm picking up a demo bike from 5 Ways in Hull. It's my favourite colour: grey with delicious blue forks, only slightly marred by the difference in shade between them and every other blue highlight on the bike. Still, this is the most attractive colour scheme of the three available. The others are a mediocre red, and an evil-looking all black, which shows off the twin red brake lights in all their demonic glory.</p>

<p>A few tasty Yamaha accessories adorn the 5 Ways demonstrator: luggage rack, radiator cover and engine protectors all round. Gareth from 5 Ways switches on the bike and proudly indicates the average fuel economy displayed on the Tracer's large rectangular dash. It reads a very respectable 51.9mpg, managed by all the test riders to sit upon the bike during its 478-mile life so far. I don't promise him either number will be recognisable when I bring the Tracer back later this afternoon.</p>

<p>Roundabouts are dissected thanks to the Tracers' high and wide bars, and I get cracking on a series of dual carriageways and A-roads. The seat height can be altered between 845mm and 860mm, higher in its lowest position than the Tracer's brother the MT-09, but doing so involves a mini adventure. Thankfully riders will only need to undertake it once. Sitting high, feet are placed on pegs comfortably situated low and forwards. It is a zen riding position, but for slow speed turns a long reach is needed to fully turn the front wheel.</p>

<p>Turning onto more minor roads, I wind up the Tracer and leap from corner to corner, rejoicing in the bike's charging progress and argumentative exhaust note. Engine and frame come loaned from the original MT-09 and there is little reason to change such a fantastic pairing of taut chassis and bounding motor. In fact, the engine is so brimming with torque that twisting the throttle in first gear will see the traction control kicking in as the triple tries to lift the front wheel. There's a noticeable cut-out while accelerating where the bike hiccups to keep its leading tyre on the tarmac. Switch the TCS off, though, and the Tracer's front lifts in a smooth and controlled manner. Yes sir, very satisfying. Second and third gears are equally stimulating and keep doling out torque and power from 4,000rpm all the way to the respectable red line.</p>

<p>Stock front suspension gives a little in corners, but keep the throttle action smooth and the Tracer stays composed while it carves a path to the apex. Steering remains pin-sharp whatever is thrown at it. Simply put, this bike is absolute fun on smaller roads like these.</p>

<p>Looking down, the Tracer has a new and larger dash than the MT-09's slitty affair. This more rectangular one, with its black-and-white display, looks fine until it needs to tell you something. A smattering of colour at the top of the rev range and on the lower fuel gauge would be very useful touches, and could be saving me from testing how well the triple engine runs on fumes right now.</p>

<p>I finger through the three riding modes as I head back to 5 Ways to drop off the Tracer, 18 litre fuel tank now brimming full. Shut the throttle and I can change modes on the fly. I'm happy with Standard on this A-road, with its smooth, high-speed corners and long views. The A-mode, obviously short for Agressive, provides near-digital throttle response and full power, great for releasing adrenaline on B-roads. B-mode restricts the bike to 95bhp and smooths off throttle response, bringing you power in a manageable way. Switch the Tracer into B on smaller roads and ask it to leap to your every command and you might be disappointed, but it is useful – and also needed – for town riding and motorway sections. Here, I become thankful for the relaxed response as it reduces snatchy throttle response at junctions.</p>

<blockquote class="container"><p>The Tracer has been praised for its firm suspension, but it's a little too firm for my 9.5 stone. While composed on smooth surfaces, I've had it nearly bounce me out of the seat a few times today. The other area of distress is the screen: fiddly to adjust with two screws, it either funnels air to buffet my chest in the lower position, or my helmet in the higher. At 5 feet and 8 inches, I would rather choose the smooth wind blast from the road than buffeting against my helmet. If long journeys are top of your list of priorities, consider investing in an aftermarket part in the wind defending category.</p></blockquote>

<p>What do you get for £8,150? As standard the bike is fitted with adjustable screen, adjustable seat, hand guards, a centrestand and a useful 12-volt power socket. This is an impressive collection of fitments for what could be called a budget priced motorcycle. The extras list is long, and I would suggest a sojourn with the larger screen for riders my height and taller. Lucky blighters.</p>

<p>Despite suspension a little too firm for my liking, a screen that doesn't quite protect a rider from wind blast, and a sidestand that jostles with the left foot peg for room, this bike is fantastic value and a joy to ride. If you're thinking of putting hard-earned cash down in return for an R1200GS, consider taking a Tracer out for a test. Lighter, cheaper, and as fun to tackle British roads on, this is the bike most new GS riders could have bought instead. Anyone want to save £3,750?</p>
